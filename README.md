This project served as a way for me to play with the new [react-redux hooks api](https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks) and it turned out to be a lot of fun. The Reddit api is also a pleasure to work with.

**Get it running**

`git clone git@github.com:trblackw/react-redux-hooks-reddit.git`

`cd react-redux-hooks-reddit`

`yarn; yarn start` || `npm i; npm start`

(React app will fire up on localhost:3000)
